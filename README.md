# Mobile Phones Specs and Prices in Kenya.

-----
This is a project aimed at building a pipepile for mobile phone price prediction using phone features and specifications.

## Data Collection
The data was collected through website scrapping from [priceinkenya.com](https://www.priceinkenya.com) and prices (which were missing) from [jumia.co.ke](https://www.jumia.co.ke)  
Used were the scripts *crawl.py* and *pricefromjumia.py* respectively above.

## Data Updates
Updating the data will happen annually as phone prices keep changing over time and new mobile phones continue to be manufactured.  
Recent and updated data will be available at the kaggle dashboard of this dataset [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/lyraxvinns/mobile-phones-specifications-and-prices-in-kenya)

# Project Lifecycle

-----
This project assumes a whole Data Science project lifecycle from data collection to deployment.  
Phases of this cycle will be updated as they get accomplished.

## Takeaways
Some insightful materials to take from this project for fellow Data Science and Machine Learning enthusiasts and learners who would like to tackle a similar project include the used scripts to acquire data and the jupyter notebooks available in the notebooks folder above detailing data manipulation and modeling techniques.
